Data type: scriptable

--Overview--

Many [[type:style]] properties are ''scriptable''; their value can be changed by a script.

Consider for example:
>left: 123
This defines that the left coordinate of a field is 123 pixels.
To script this you can write:
>left: { if card.name == "" then 100 else 123 }
Now the left position depends on whether or not the name is empty.

--File syntax--
A 'scriptable something' can take three forms:
# It can be a regular 'something'
  >something: 123
# It can be a script that produces 'something', enclosed in curly braces:
  >something: {100 + 23}
# It can be a script that produces 'something', indented and preceded by @script:@:
  >something:
  >	script: 100 + 23

Note: To use a multiline script the following does not work:
>something: { 100 +
>             23 }
If the script has multiple lines, it must start on a new line, and be indented with a TAB:
>something:
>	{ 100 +
>	  23 }
or
>something:
>	script: 100 +
>	        23
