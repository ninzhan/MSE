Data type: dependency

--Overview--

[[type:Package]]s can depend on other packages.
For example a [[type:stylesheet]] needs a particular version of the corresponding [[type:game]] package, and maybe some additional [[type:include]]s.

--Properties--
! Property	Type			Description
| @package@	[[type:string]]		Filename of the package this package depends on.
| @version@	[[type:version]]	Minimal version of that package that is required.

The two properties can also be written on a single line, separated by a space (see the examples).

--Example--
The magic-new stylesheet depends on a particular version of the game file:
>depends on:
>	package: magic.mse-game
>	version: 2007-06-06
This can be written more compactly as
>depends on: magic.mse-game 2007-06-06
