Data type: string with tags

--Syntax--
Strings in [[type:value|text values]] can contain markup tags.
These tags affect the presentation and sometimes the behaviour of the text.

A tag is something like @"<tag>some text</tag>"@, similar to HTML.
Tags are closed by the same tag with a @/@ before it.

To represent the character @"<"@ in a tagged string use @"\<"@ in script code.
This is written as the character with code 1 in files.

--Basic markup--
! Tag			Description
| @<b>@			The text inside the tag is bold.
| @<i>@			The text inside the tag is italic.
| @<sym>@		The text inside the tag is rendered as symbols, if a [[prop:style:symbol font]] is set for the text box.
| @<color:???>@		The text inside the tag is rendered with the given [[type:color]].
| @<size:???>@		The text inside the tag is rendered with the given font size in points, for example @"<size:12>text</size>"@ makes the text 12 points. The text is scaled down proportionally when it does not fit in a text box and the @scale down to@ attribute allows it.
| @<line>@		Line breaks inside this tag use the [[prop:style:line height line]], and they show a horizontal line.
| @<soft-line>@		Line breaks inside this tag use the [[prop:style:soft line height]].
| @<atom>@		An atomic piece of text. The cursor can never be inside it; it is selected as a whole.
			The program automatically inserts @<atom-soft>@.
| @<code>@		The text inside the tag is rendered in a monospace font. This is used for syntax highlighting script code.
| @<code-kw>@		The text inside the tag is highlighted as a keyword in source code.
| @<code-str>@		The text inside the tag is highlighted as a string in source code.


--Other tags--
! Tag			Description
| @<kw-?>@		Indicates that the text inside it is a keyword. This tag is automatically inserted by
			The [[fun:expand_keywords]] function.<br/>
			There are four versions, indicating whether or not reminder text is shown:
			* @<kw-0>@, Reminder text hidden, by default
			* @<kw-1>@, Reminder text shown, by default
			* @<kw-a>@, Reminder hidden manually
			* @<kw-A>@, Reminder shown manually
| @<sep>@		A separator between fields. This tag is automatically inserted by the [[fun:combined_editor]] function.<br/>
			Inserting this tag manually will confuse that function!<br/>
			This tag can never be selected, and its contents can not be edited.
| @<prefix>@		At the beginning of a string, indicates a part that can not be selected. This tag is automatically inserted by the [[fun:combined_editor]] function.
| @<suffix>@		At the end of a string, indicates a part that can not be selected. This tag is automatically inserted by the [[fun:combined_editor]] function.
| @<sep-soft>@		Like @<sep>@, only hidden. This is inserted by [[fun:combined_editor]]
| @<soft>@		Text who's width is ignored for alignment, similar to @<sep-soft>@, but not a separator.
| @<word-list-???>@	Indicate that the text inside the tag should be selected from a [[type:word list]].
			The <tt>???</tt> must be the name of a word list in the game.
| @<error>@		The text inside the tag is an error, and is shown with a red wavy underline.
| @<error-spelling:???>@	A spelling error, marked by the [[fun::check_spelling]] function.
			The <tt>???</tt> part indicates the language used for spelling checking.
| any other tag		Other tags are ignored.
