Collection type: List

--File syntax--
In files a list is represented as multiple keys, one for each element.
The keys are all in the singular for of the name of the list,
if the list is named for instance @symbols@ each key will be named @symbol@.
>symbol:
>	# first symbol here
>symbol:
>	# second symbol here
># etc.

--Script syntax--
In a script lists can be declared using square brackets.
> []    # An empty list
> [1]   # A list with a single element, the value 1
> [1,2] # A list with two elements

Lists can be accessed using either the bracket operator, or the dot operator.
The first element of a list is numbered 0, the next 1, etc.
> list.0    # The first element of the list 'list'
> list[0]   # The same thing
> list[0+0] # The same thing

It is possible to iterate over lists using the @for each@ construct:
> for each x in [1,2,3] do "x = {x}. "
evaluates to:
> "x = 1. x = 2. x = 3. "

--Functions--
There are several functions for working with lists:
| [[fun:position]]		Find the position of an element in a list
| [[fun:number_of_items]]	Return the number of items in a list
| [[fun:sort_list]]		Sort a list
| [[fun:filter_list]]		Filter a list, keeping only elements that match a predicate
