Data type: symbol control point

--Overview--

A single [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_curve|B&eacute;zier curve]] control point in a [[type:symbol part|symbol shape]].

A control point is a point on the polygon.
It also optionally has two 'handles' corresponding to the boxes attached with dotted lines in the editor.

The control points of a shape are circular, the point after the last point in the list is the first point.

--Properties--
! Property		Type			Default		Description
| @position@		[[type:vector2d]]	 		Position of the control point.
| @lock@		@free@, @direction@ or @size@	 @"free"@
			 			 		Is this point 'locked', i.e. is the relation between the two handles fixed?<br/>
			 			 		If @lock@ is @"direction"@ then the two handles must lie on a line.<br/>
			 			 		If @lock@ is @"direction"@ then the two handles must lie exactly oppisite each other on the same distance from the point.
| @line after@		@line@ or @curve@	@"line"@	Is the segment between this control point and the next one in the list a straight line or a cubic B&eacute;zier curve?
| @handle before@	[[type:vector2d]]	 		Position of the handle for the segment between this point and the previous one, relative to the point's @position@.<br/>Only when that point's @line after == "curve"@.
| @handle after@	[[type:vector2d]]	 		Position of the handle for the segment between this point and the next one, relative to the point's @position@.<br/>Only when @line after == "curve"@.

--Example--
Look at a symbol file made with the program.
