MSE Command line

Magic set editor can be started from the command prompt by typing:

]mse
in Windows, or
]magicseteditor
on other platforms.

The MSE program has several flags for choosing different behaviour.

--Starting the GUI--

]mse
Invoking MSE with no arguments shows the welcome window.

]]mse <em>my-set.mse-set</em>
Invoking MSE with the filename of a [[type:set]] shows the main window with that set loaded.
This command is automatically invoked when you double click on a set file in a file manager.

]mse my-symbol.mse-symbol
Invoking MSE with the filename of a [[type:symbol]] shows the symbol editor window with that symbol loaded.

]mse --symbol-editor
With the <tt>--symbol-editor</tt> flag the symbol editor is started with a blank symbol.

--Information about MSE--

]mse --version
The <tt>--version</tt> flag (abbreviate as <tt>-v</tt>) writes the version number of MSE to the standard output,
 or in a message box if MSE was not started from the command prompt.

]mse --help
The <tt>--help</tt> flag (abbreviate as <tt>-?</tt>) displays a list of available flags to the standard output,
 or in a message box if MSE was not started from the command prompt.

--Installers--

]]mse <em>my-installer.mse-installer</em>
Invoking MSE with the filename of an [[type:installer]] shows the package window, from where the packages in that installer can be installed.
By passing the <tt>--local</tt> or <tt>--global</tt> flag you can change where the package will be installed.
Global installation is for all users, local installation is for the current user only (see [[file:index|data directories]]).

]mse --create-installer <em>output.mse-installer</em> <em>package1.mse-game</em> <em>package2.mse-game</em> ...
Creates an installer package containing one or more packages from the mse [[file:index|data directory]].
The installer will be written to <tt><em>output.mse-installer</em></tt>. This name can be omitted, in which case the name of the first package will be used (in this case <tt>package1.mse-installer</tt>).

--Interactive cli interface--

]mse --cli
Starts the [[cli:cli|Interactive command line interface]].
Optionally the filename of a set can be passed which will then be loaded.
