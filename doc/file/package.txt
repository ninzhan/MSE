Packages

Most files used by Magic Set Editor are stored in ''packages''.

A package is either a zip file or simply a directory.

A package has an extension to indicate its type, for example @"*.mse-set"@ is a [[type:set]] file and @"*.mse-symbol-font"@ is a [[type:symbol font]].
To open a zipped package using a program like winzip you may need to rename it to @"something.zip"@

--Contents--

A package always contains a [[file:format|heirarchical data file]] with the same name as the package type and no extension.
For example @"my-set.mse-set"@ contains a file called @"set"@.

A package can also contain other files like images.

--Examples--

The [[file:index|data directory]] contains packages in the form of directories.
Each of the subdirectories is a package.
