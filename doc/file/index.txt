--Data directories--
The data files that come with Magic Set Editor are stored in [[file:package]]s in the ''data directory'',
these are usually subdirectories of that directory.

There are two data directories, a ''global'' one with data files installed with the program,
and a ''local'' data directory for the current logged in user.
The latter is used for installing packages if the user doesn't have administrator priviliges.

The location of the global data directory is
! On windows	<<<
| Location	<tt><i>%MSE_DIR%</i>\data</tt>
| Usually	<tt>C:\Program Files\Magic Set Editor 2\data</tt>
! On linux/unix	<<<

The location of the local data directory is
! On windows	<<<
| Location	<tt><i>%USER_APPLICATION_DATA%</i>\Magic Set Editor\data</tt>
| Usually	<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>%USERNAME%</i>\Application Data\Magic Set Editor\data</tt>
