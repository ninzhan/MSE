--Names--

The full name of a choice is that of the choice and its parents, separated by spaces.
This is the value actually stored in values and manipulated by scripts.

For example
>field:
>	type: choice
>	choice:
>		name: large
>		choice: red
>		choice: blue
>	choice:
>		name: small
>		group choice: just small
>		choice: green
>		choice: yellow

The choice red is called @"large red"@, while green is @"small green"@.
The group choice 'just small' gets the name of the group, @"small"@.

--Example--
In short form:
>choice: apples
Is the same as:
>choice:
>	name: apples
