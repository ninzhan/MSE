Primitive type: regular expression

Regular expressions (regexes) are things that can match parts of [[type:string]]s.

Regexes are represented by normal [[type:string]]s.
Note that to escape something in a regex the backslash is used, in script code this also needs to be escaped.
For example, in a script, the regex matching a single backslash is @"\\\\"@.
