Collection type: Map

A map is like a [[type:list]] with [[type:string]] keys.

--File syntax--
In files a map is represented as key/value pairs.
For instance a map of [[type:color]]s could be:
>some map:
>	red:   rgb(255,0,0)
>	green: rgb(0,255,0)
>	blue:  rgb(0,0,255)

--Script syntax--
In a script maps can be declared using square brackets.
> []      # An empty map
> [key:1] # A map with a single element, the value 1 under the key "key"
> [red:rgb(255,0,0), green:rgb(0,255,0)] # A map with two elements

Like lists, maps can be accessed using either the bracket operator, or the dot operator.
> map.key       # The elment named "key"
> map["k"+"ey"] # The same thing

It is possible to iterate over the values maps using the @for@ construct:
> for each x in [one: 1, two: 2] do "x = {x}. "
evaluates to:
> "x = 1. x = 2. "
